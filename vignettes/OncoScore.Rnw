\begin{tcolorbox}{\bf Overview.} \OncoScore{} is a tool to measure the association of genes to cancer based
    on citation frequency in biomedical literature. The score is evaluated 
    from PubMed literature by dynamically updatable web queries.

\vspace{1.0cm}


{\em In this vignette, we give an overview of the package by presenting some of its main functions.}

The \OncoScore{} analysis consists of two parts. One can estimate a score to asses 
the oncogenic potential of a set of genes, given the lecterature knowledge, 
at the time of the analysis, or one can study the trend of such score over time.

We next present the two analysis and we conclude with showing the capabilities
of the tool to visualize the results.

\paragraph{\large Requirements. } First we load the library.

<<>>=
library(OncoScore)
@

\paragraph{\large OncoScore analysis.} The query that we show next retrieves
from PubMed the citations, at the time of the query, for a list of genes in
cancer related and in all the documents.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
query = perform.query(c("ASXL1","IDH1","IDH2","SETBP1","TET2"))
@
\begin{verbatim}
### Starting the queries for the selected genes.

    Number of papers found in PubMed for ASXL1 was: 309

    Number of papers found in PubMed for IDH2 was: 557 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for SETBP1 was: 69 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for TET2 was: 560

OncoScore provides a function to merge gene names if requested by the user.
This function is useful when there are aliases in the gene list. 

<<>>=
combine.query.results(query, c('IDH1', 'IDH2'), 'new_gene')
@

OncoScore also provides a function to retireve the names of the genes in a given 
portion of a chromosome that can be exploited if we are dealing, e.g., with copy 
number alterations hitting regions rather than specific genes. 

<<eval=FALSE>>=
chr13 = get.genes.from.biomart(chromosome=13,start=54700000,end=72800000)
head(chr13)
@
\begin{verbatim}
[1] "LINC00374" "RNA5SP30"  "RNU7-87P"  "HNF4GP1"   "RN7SL375P" "BORA"
\end{verbatim}


Furthermore, one can also automatically perform the OncoScore analysis on
chromosomic regions as follows:

<<eval=FALSE>>=
result = compute.oncoscore.from.region(10, 100000, 500000)
@
\begin{verbatim}
### Performing query on BioMart

    Number of papers found in PubMed for RNA5SP298 was: -1 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for RN7SL754P was: -1 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for ZMYND11 was: 27 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for DIP2C was: 1

    Number of papers found in PubMed for ZMYND11 was: 45 
    Number of papers found in PubMed for DIP2C was: 3

### Computing frequencies scores 
### Estimating oncogenes
### Results:
     RNA5SP297 -> 0 
     RNA5SP298 -> 0 
     RN7SL754P -> 0 
     ZMYND11 -> 49.07473 
     DIP2C -> 12.30234 
\end{verbatim}


We now compute a score for each of the genes, to estimate their oncogenic
potential.

\paragraph{\large OncoScore timeline analysis.} The query that we show next retrieves
from PubMed the citations, at specified time points, for a list of genes in
cancer related and in all the documents.
